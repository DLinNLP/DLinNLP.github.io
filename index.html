				<h2>Welcome</h2>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The 1st Summer School on Deep Learning in NLP will take place as part of the 12th biennial RANLP conference (<a href="http://lml.bas.bg/ranlp2019/firstCfP.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RANLP 2019</a>) from 29 to 30 August 2019 in the city of Varna, Bulgaria.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Deep Learning is a branch of machine learning that has gained significant traction and has advanced the state of the art in Artificial Intelligence, with many sub-disciplines, including natural language, image, and speech processing, employing it widely in their best-performing models.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>This summer school will feature presentations from outstanding researchers in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning. These will include coverage of recent advances in theoretical foundations and will be held in conjunction with practical coding sessions showcasing the latest relevant technology.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The summer school would be of interest to novices and established practitioners in the fields of NLP, corpus linguistics, language technologies, and similar related areas.</p>
